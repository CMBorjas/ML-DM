# Langchain

Langchain is a powerful library for building and deploying machine learning models. This README provides an overview of the project structure and instructions for getting started.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains datasets used for training and evaluation.
- **models/**: Includes pre-trained models and scripts for training new models.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and analysis.
- **scripts/**: Utility scripts for data processing and model evaluation.
- **tests/**: Unit tests for ensuring code quality and correctness.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11.10 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cmandujanoborjas/langchain.git
    cd langchain
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage (Tenative)

1. Prepare your data by placing it in the `data/` directory.
2. Train a model using the scripts in the `models/` directory.
3. Evaluate the model using the notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory.
